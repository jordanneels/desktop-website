		<h1> Jordan Neels </h1>

		<h3> My Experience with Web </h3>
		<p> The only experience I have with web is the one technology class I took in high school where I created a simple webpage. Fortunately, I have been able to remember a fair amount from it so I'm not starting from scratch with this class! </p>

		<h3> My Experience with Photoshop </h3>
		<p> I was introduced to and have been working with Photoshop since Spring of 2013 when I took Computer Graphics. </p>

		<h3> My Experience with Illustrator </h3>
		<p> I was also introduced to Illustrator in Spring of 2013, and have been working with it since then. </p>

		<h3> My Experience with InDesign </h3>
		<p> InDesign was the third and final design program I was introduced to in Spring of 2013, and have been working with it since then. </p>

		<h3> My future career desires are... </h3>
		<p> Once I finish at Eastern, I would like to write, edit, and publish for magazines or newspapers. </p>

		<h3> I see myself using this course content in my future career as... </h3>
		<p> The coding knowledge may not be used very much, but I'm glad to have it. The publication skills will be helpful when doing page layout for magazines and newspapers. </p>

<!--Correct the ï¿½ (unkown symbol) with proper quote marks . -->
		<p class="quotes"> "If your dreams don't scare you, they're not big enough."

		<h3> If I were a superhero, I would be </h3>
		<h4> Silk Scepter </h4>
		<p> I picked Silk Scepter because I needed to pick a superheroine. And she's portrayed by Malin Ackerman. Which makes her automatically cool. </p>
