<h3> Life Quotes</h3>
<p class="quotes"> "If your dreams don't scare you, they're not big enough."
<br /> Rachael McIntosh </p>

<h3> My Experience with Web </h3>
<p> The only experience I have with web is the one technology class I took in high school where I created a simple webpage. Fortunately, I have been able to remember a fair amount from it so I'm not starting from scratch with this class! </p>

<h3> My Experience with Photoshop </h3>
<p> I was introduced to and have been working with Photoshop since Spring of 2013 when I took Computer Graphics. </p>

<h3> My Experience with Illustrator </h3>
<p> I was also introduced to Illustrator in Spring of 2013, and have been working with it since then. </p>

<h3> My Experience with InDesign </h3>
<p> InDesign was the third and final design program I was introduced to in Spring of 2013, and have been working with it since then. </p>

<h3> My future career desires are... </h3>
<p> Once I finish at Eastern, I would like to write, edit, and publish for magazines or newspapers. </p>

<h3> I see myself using this course content in my future career as... </h3>
<p> The coding knowledge may not be used very much, but I'm glad to have it. The publication skills will be helpful when doing page layout for magazines and newspapers. </p>
